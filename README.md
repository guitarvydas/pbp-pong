Implementing Pong using PBP. Experimental and WIP at this time, but usable...

See `./design-sketches` for the latest status updates.

See `./code/Building a Visual Test Jig Using Tools You Already Have.md` for an explanation of the current avenue for exploration - designing a test jig to help visually debug the ball part. (More to come, like debugging the paddle stuff). I will be further tweaking this article and expect to add a diagram.

To run the test jig, see `./code/README.md`.
