I want to build a test jig that displays the slave GUI in a browser window like in in the other chats for this project and lets me send commands to it from the command line.

Do I need a background daemon that opens a websocket to the GUI and keeps it open? How do I send data packets to the daemon to be forwarded to the GUI?

I want to send commands to the GUI through the daemon on the command line by hand and programmatically from some program that I run on the command line
