Bits of progress on the sketches. I'm bouncing around and drilling down into various parts that I want to think about. 

The fact that it's a holiday week isn't helping my concentration. At least I've got a record (in draw.io) of what I was thinking before in between interruptions...

The Ball Stepper part is already looking implementable. I started writing Python code for it, then switched to using the meta-language `.rt`. I guess I'm going to hack on `emitPython.rwr` and `emitjs.rwr` and `emitcl.rwr` in the pbp/kernel subdirectory, to add various "external" . The kernel is itself written in `.rt` and can already generate Python, JS and CL. I need to check if enough stuff has been copied into the subdirectory `pbp/tas` to allow me to tweak the `.rt` meta-language???

At this moment, I'm expecting to do this in Python, but, you never know. It's better to try to write the textual code in the meta-language and to defer the choice of actual implementation language until the design is more clear to me. Anyway, the fact that the meta-language needs to encompass at least 3 other quite different PLs is causing me to simplify and to not take advantage of Python features that don't map to other PLs.

When I get to the point of actually testing textual code, I'm going to need to add some rules to the Makefile to generate the code, say, in Python. Question to self: am I going to build a transmogrifier pipeline in PBP, like I did in html-larson???

Pond'ring: when it gets to testing and debugging the Ball Stepper part, I will probably do it on the command line and watch streams of numbers go by. But, it sure would be nice to visualize the results in a browser,,, which makes me think about whether I want to get the GUI going in the browser first. But, that will need to be debugged. Decisions, decisions. Can I describe the GUI well enough to just let Claude build it??? I'm not very interested in the GUI details, so I wouldn't mind punting the implementation work. This leads me to want to design the GUI so that I could command it from the command line, interactively using the REPL generally known as the "terminal" (or "console" or "command line"). I've succeeded in using Claude to write the HTML code before,,, and, the API for this GUI is only 4 ports (at the moment). Hmmmm.
